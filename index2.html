	<h1>Dear teachers,</h1>
	<p>I just wanted to inform you that I don't have a Linkedin profile yet because i've already find an internship; but i wanted to show you that I can create a new website and put a link in my profile, change the color when you put your mouse on it... I wanted to try and train because i really enjoy programming!</p>
